# Vehicle Cut-in Detection

## Overview
Cut-in detection is crucial for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving. It involves identifying instances where a vehicle abruptly moves into the lane of another vehicle.
Detecting such maneuvers in real-time is essential for maintaining road safety and enabling autonomous vehicles to make informed decisions.

## Features
Data Preprocessing: Tools for preparing and augmenting the dataset.

Model Training: Scripts to train models using various architectures.

Inference: Code to run inference on new data.

Evaluation: Metrics and evaluation scripts to assess model performance.

Visualization: Tools to visualize the results and performance.
